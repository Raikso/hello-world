Er mah gerd! This is (not) a fantastic way to work! Just think of all the extra work that is needed to bring together all of the branches to a new master again! When working with a project with several people it is a smart move to let them all take part of the master project to work on a branch, but there has to be at least a weekly update to the master project (preferably more often).
